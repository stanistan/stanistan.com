## Usage

- All edits should happen on `the-details` branch.
- `master` is reserved for the build output, and is generated by [zola][zola]

The `README` (this file), is symlinked to the `static/` directory, which
gets copied into `public/`, so this should also _only_ get edited on
`the-details` branch.

### When writing a blog post

Make a file somewhere in `content/writes`, it doesn't really matter where it is,
even though the directories should be organized by date.

When the file has a `date` field filled in the front-matter:

```bash
bin/verify-content-dates
```

This script will move the post to its correct directory (by date format `YYYY-MM-DD`),
creating the subdirectories in between.

### Shipping

```bash
# Makes sure the files are in their correct sub-paths
bin/verify-content-dates

# build the site to the public/ dir
zola build

# commit the changes on the branch.
git add <whatever>
git commit

# deploy public/ to the master branch
bin/ship
```
