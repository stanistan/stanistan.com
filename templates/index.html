        Hi, I'm Stan, sometimes referred to as stanistan. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Formerly at <a href="https://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a>, where I worked
        on lots of things as a Software Engineer &amp; Product Infrastructure
        Architect; an alumn of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>;
        and a perpetual work in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find some of my work on <a href="https://github.com/stanistan">github</a>.
