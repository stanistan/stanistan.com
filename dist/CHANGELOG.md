__All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.__

This is based off of [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

There are no real _releases_, or _tags_ here since this is not a library
or anything, but I felt like it would be fun (besides just git history)
to keep a log of how the site has changed over time.

This should be in reverse chronological order.

### 2019-11-14

#### New

- Support and styling for [anchor links][anchor-links] on posts.

- `Makefile` supports the env var `$BASE_URL`, this is useful if
  I want to check the site from my phone during development, using
  [internet sharing on MacOS][internet-sharing].

- Adding a `CHANGELOG.md`, which is symlinked and served as `/changelog`.

#### Updated

- `bin/verify-content-dates` updated to use symlinks for the autogenerated
  section `_index.md` files.

- Better sizing/spacing for mobile web.

- The post [How this site works](@/writes/2019/11/10/how-this-blog-works.md)
  was updated to reflect the fixes to the `CNAME` (bug fixe below) and the
  symlinking dates directories.

#### Fixed

- No longer have to deal with weird `master` merge issues because
  `bin/ship` force pushes master. This was a problem before because
  the master branch _needs_ to have a `CNAME` file for custom domains
  to work well. Fixed by symlinking it to `static/` the same way that
  the REAMDE is, and this file is.
