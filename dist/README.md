Personal website. Powered by [zola][zola].

## Usage

- All edits should happen on `the-details` branch.
- `master` is reserved for the build output, and is generated by [zola][zola]

The `README` (this file), is symlinked to the `static/` directory, which
gets copied into `dist/`, so this should also _only_ get edited on
`the-details` branch.

### When writing a blog post

Make a file somewhere in `content/writes`, it doesn't really matter where it is,
even though the directories should be organized by date.

When the file has a `date` field filled in the front-matter:

```bash
make verify-content-dates
```

This script will move the post to its correct directory (by date format `YYYY-MM-DD`),
creating the subdirectories in between.

```bash
make serve-dev
```

This will serve drafts and show the debug data and `__tera_context` in the templates.

```bash
make serve-prod
```

This will show the site as it _would_ be once deployed.

### Deploying

```bash
make deploy
```

When running this command, this makes sure all changes to content/templates/etc
have been committed, so the only things that will be autogenerated will be
shipped at once.

See the scripts in the [`bin/`](./bin) directory for more info.
